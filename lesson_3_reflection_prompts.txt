When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    I will like to use the remote repository when I need to save my work for being lost.
    When we are connecting to the remote repository, we are on the safer side that our work
    and all the commits done will remain safe and can be accesible whenever we want and also
    when we want other people also to work on our project or code, then it's necessary for
    the code to be there in remote so that other people can also access the code and do the 
    necessary changes required to build the project.    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
