How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was much more easier to find out the bug while checking out two diff
    versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will be awesome if I will be having the access to the entire history
    what I did on the code. I will make me very much efficient programmer in 
    the long term. Like in daily life I use to feel that whenever I use to 
    do any changes in my code, the older version of code no longer remains
    there. If I wish to see that what I did in the past code, then I am unable
    to access that. So I think if the history of my code will be there all the 
    time it would be a great learning experience as well for me and It can 
    help me to become more efficiant with the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think if it's our choice when to commit and when to not, that's really
    good idea as the key will be in our hand and we will be knowing that when
    we have done something. But sometimes it's good as well when we the versions use to save automatically. Sometimes we may forget to commit
    or something happend, autmotically saving versions are also good at 
    some point but overall I think that the liberty to choose when to 
    commit is better than the automatically saving the versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when files are interrelated to each other, it becomes easy to
    keep track of that what things having chaged when we made changes in 
    one file and how that file cause the changes in the other file. I 
    think it's a awesome feature provided by Git that keep tracks of 
    all the files realted to each other simultanously.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" will show me the past recents commits done in the repository
    with the Commit id, author, date and message for that commit. I can then
    easily pick up any two commit id's and can use "git diff" command to see
    the changes occured in the two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it for my upcoming Portfolio project.
