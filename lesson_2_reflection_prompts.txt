What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When we initialize a repository using "git init" command, the ".git" folder
	use to create with all the "meta" data and "config" file. I don't 
	know much about these two things. But after initializing the 
	repository only, the Git use to track the files present in the 
	repository. Otherwise if we won't initialize the Git in the 
	repository, the Git commands will not work. When we initialize GIT,
	then only it becomes a "Git repository".

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	I think staging area is the bridge between the working direcotry and the
	repository. We can deside and add the files in the staging area, for which
	we want to make commit. It also helps us to remove the files from this area
	if we don't want to add the file for a single commit.
	The staging area offers us the details about the files present in the
	working directory, that which file is going to be add in the repository
	and which file is still untracked. It gives a liberty to choose single 
	commit with single file or single commit with multifile files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	I can see, when the file is use to be in the Staging area, we can use the 
	"git diff --staged" command to see the difference b/w the file present in 
	repository and the staging area and come to know about the changes we 
	are about to commit. So in this way we can know that we are doing one
	commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	I think this the coolest feature of making the braches in our repository.
	It will make us very relax and comfertable and allows us to experiment 
	on the code written without disturbing the original code. It gives 
	us the freedom to do whatever u want without taking care what will happen
	to the real code. Branches are awesome !!!!

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Branch strucutre is extermly helpful to understand each and every concept
	of Git so far. It's more easy to visualize that what actually is happening
	and specially in the learning phase these diagrams are very much helpful
	to understand the concepts.
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
